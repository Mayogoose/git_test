#git test
My first Github repo! 
Here's a rough plan for my personal website project for 2023 summer:
1. The landing page consist of:
    - my live2d model (JSON file) that is interactive with user's mouse movement
    - three pictures of chibi character that fade in and out periodically, and direct users to my about page, playground page, and notion page when being clicked
    - star particles that blink randomly on top of my live2d model
2. design a web prototype on figma, design it on wix, and export the code to VSCode
3. integrate my live 2d model using official web sdk
4. organize and summarize my high school design achievement, including:
    [[[[Current work, later be placed in archived]]]]
    - design merch and logo for RHS choir
    - design posters and marks for PAC 
    - AP Art portfolio (YouTube explanation, web presentation)
    - UW fearless tech more hackathon: Motherland (case study include figma ideation, uw website)
    [[[[About me, experience and hobbies]]]]
    - Leadership @ Design Club (collaboration with colleges, shrinky dinks and sticker workshop)
    - Leadership Choir VP (serve people, plan events, merch fundraisers)
    - Music performances (Aside from design, I do music...)
